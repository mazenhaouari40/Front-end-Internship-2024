# Absence Management Web Application
## ðŸ“‹ Project Objective
This web application is designed to streamline the process of managing absences. It provides an intuitive platform for collaborators to request absences and for managers and administrators to process and manage these requests efficiently.

### Features:
Collaborator Absence Requests:
Request absences by specifying the type (e.g., illness), start date, and end date.
Submit requests for manager approval or rejection.
Manager Actions:
Approve or reject absence requests.
Notifications and real-time status updates via WebSocket technology.
Admin Section:
Add, update, or delete users.
Assign collaborators to administrators.
Real-Time Notifications:
Using WebSocket technology, the application ensures that when a manager takes action on a request, the collaborator is notified in real-time with an orange notification, and the status is automatically updated.
